        Empiria is a free to print and play board game for 2 to 4 players.
      </p>

      <p>
        The game is centered around growing your empire, attacking opponents and destroying your opponents' empires.  You use a standard 52 card deck and pay cards from your hand that add up to a specific number to perform actions.  The game is turn-based and slow-paced, but each player's turn is very quick. Each player can move their units and perform one Action per turn, leading to strategic moves and fast turns.

      <ol>
        <li>Get 1 standards 52 card deck for each player that is playing (the decks do *not* have to be the same, just as long as they are all 52 card playing-card decks).</li>
        <li>Print out the hexagonal grid (or any hexigonal grid will do)</li>
        <li>Print out the playing pieces.  If you have access to a 3D printer, we have 3D models as well!</li>

      <h2>Basic Rules</h2>

      <p>The Basic Rules are for new players or for a more streamlined playing experience.</p>

      <h3>Setup</h3>

      <div><strong>Creating a Hexagonal Board</strong></div>

      <p>For the Basic Rules, just use hexagonal tiles that all represent Grassland Tiles.</p>
      <p>You can set up the board anyway you'd like, but you can see our full list of Competitive Boards.</p>

      <div><strong>Starting</strong></div>
      <ol>
        <li>Pick a starting player.  Most of the time, rolling a die and picking the highest roll will suffice.</li>
        <li>Have each player, starting with the starting player and going counter-clockwise, pick a color for their empire.</li>
        <li>Have each player place their Empire Token on a hexagonal tile. This is the start of their empire.  The first player is at a huge disadvantage when placing their empire; but they do get to play actions first.</li>
        <li>Shuffle each player's deck.</li>
        <li>Start the game by having each player take a turn.  See the Basic Turn or the Advanced Turn depending on which difficulty of the game you are playing.</li>
