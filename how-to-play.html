        Empiria is a free to print and play board game for 2 to 4 players.
      </p>

      <p>
        The game is centered around growing your empire, attacking opponents and destroying your opponents' empires.  You use a standard 52 card deck and pay cards from your hand that add up to a specific number to perform actions.  The game is turn-based and slow-paced, but each player's turn is very quick. Each player can move their units and perform one Action per turn, leading to strategic moves and fast turns.

      <h2>Print and Play</h2>

      <p>You can get started playing this game buy just printing out the assets that we have made freely available.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Get 1 standards 52 card deck for each player that is playing (the decks do *not* have to be the same, just as long as they are all 52 card playing-card decks).</li>
        <li>Print out the hexagonal grid (or any hexigonal grid will do)</li>
        <li>Print out the playing pieces.  If you have access to a 3D printer, we have 3D models as well!</li>
        <li>Print out a Short Guide for each player.</li>
        <li>Read the Basic Rules.</li>
      </ol>


      <h2>Basic Rules</h2>

      <p>The Basic Rules are for new players or for a more streamlined playing experience.</p>

      <h3>Setup</h3>

      <div><strong>Creating a Hexagonal Board</strong></div>

      <p>For the Basic Rules, just use hexagonal tiles that all represent Grassland Tiles.</p>
      <p>You can set up the board anyway you'd like, but you can see our full list of Competitive Boards.</p>

      <div><strong>Starting</strong></div>
      <ol>
        <li>Pick a starting player.  Most of the time, rolling a die and picking the highest roll will suffice.</li>
        <li>Have each player, starting with the starting player and going counter-clockwise, pick a color for their empire.</li>
        <li>Have each player place their Empire Token on a hexagonal tile. This is the start of their empire.  The first player is at a huge disadvantage when placing their empire; but they do get to play actions first.</li>
        <li>Shuffle each player's deck.</li>
        <li>Start the game by having each player take a turn.  See the Basic Turn or the Advanced Turn depending on which difficulty of the game you are playing.</li>
      </ol>

      <div><strong>The Player's Turn</strong></div>

      The Turn Player can do any of the following Actions <strong>in order</strong> during their turn:

      <ol>      
        <li>Draw a Card</li>
        <li>Move all of their units 1 tile.  Not all units have to be moved (i.e. if you have 10 units, you can only move 1 and have the other 9 stationary)</li>
        <li>Perform a Basic Action.  See the Actions section for types of actions, costs, and how they work.  Note that these actions are also on each Short Guide.</li>
        <li>If your Action was to Attack, perform the Battle Steps:
          <ol>
            <li>The Turn Player picks one of their units and one of their opponent's units that is <strong>adjacent</strong> to the unit they picked.</li>
            <li>The Turn Player and the owner of the other unit:
              <ol>
                <li>Take the top three cards of their deck and place them <strong>face-down</strong> (without looking at them) on their discard pile.</li>
                <li>Take the next card from both decks and place it <strong>face-up</strong> on their discard pile.</li>
                <li>The highest value card is the winner.  If both cards have the same value, do sub-steps 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 again until the cards are not the same value.</li>
                <li>The winner takes all of the <strong>face-down</strong> cards in their discard pile and adds them to their hand.</li>
                <li>The loser takes all of their <strong>face-down</strong> cards and flips them <strong>face-up</strong> back in their discard pile.</li>
                <li>The loser takes their unit and destroys it.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>It is now the end of the Turn Player's Turn
      </ol>
