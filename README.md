Empiria
=======

The print and play board game.

For 2-4 Players.

The game is centered around growing your empire, attacking opponents and destroying your opponents' empires.  You use a standard 52 card deck and pay cards from your hand that add up to a specific number to perform actions.  The game is turn-based and slow-paced, but each player's turn is very quick. Each player can move their units and perform one Action per turn, leading to strategic moves and fast turns.

# Print and Play

1. Get 1 standards 52 card deck for each player that is playing (the decks do *not* have to be the same, just as long as they are all 52 card playing-card decks).
2. Print out the hexagonal grid (or any hexigonal grid will do)
3. Print out the playing pieces.  If you have access to a 3D printer, we have 3D models as well!
4. Print out a Short Guide for each player.
5. Read the full rules.

# Rules

## Setup

### Create a hexagonal board

For basic rules, just use dirt hexagonal tiles.  For advanced rules, use all types of hexagonal tiles.

You can set up the board anyway you'd like, but you can see our full list of Competitive Boards.

## Starting and picking empires

1. Pick a starting player.  Most of the time, rolling a die and picking the highest roll will suffice.
2. Have each player, starting with the starting player and going counter-clockwise, pick a color for their empire.
3. Have each player place their Empire Token on a hexagonal tile. This is the start of their empire.  The first player is at a huge disadvantage when placing their empire; but they do get to play actions first.
4. Shuffle each player's deck.
5. Start the game by having each player take a turn.  See the Basic Turn or the Advanced Turn depending on which difficulty of the game you are playing.

## Basic Rules

### Basic Turn

The Turn Player can do any of these actions *in order* during their turn:

1. Draw a Card
2. Move all of their units 1 tile.  Not all units have to be moved (i.e. if you have 10 units, you can only move 1 and have the other 9 stationary)
3. Perform a Basic Action.  See the Actions section for types of actions, costs, and how they work.  Note that these actions are also on each Short Guide.
4. If your Action was to Attack, perform the Battle Steps:
    1. The Turn Player picks one of their units and one of their opponent's units that is *adjacent* to the unit they picked.
    2. The Turn Player and the owner of the other unit:
        1. Take the top three cards of their deck and place them *face-down* (without looking at them) on their discard pile.
        2. Take the next card from both decks and place it *face-up* on their discard pile.
        3. The highest value card is the winner.  If both cards have the same value, do sub-steps 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 again until the cards are not the same value.
        4. The winner takes all of the *face-down* cards in their discard pile and adds them to their hand.
        5. The loser takes all of their *face-down* cards and flips them *face-up* back in their discard pile.
        6. The loser takes their unit and destroys it.
5. It is now the end of the Turn Player's Turn
