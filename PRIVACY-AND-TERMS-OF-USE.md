# Privacy

Empiria respects your privacy.  We do not collect personally identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily provide it, such as when you provide email contact information to subscribe to the Empiria newsletter, send feeback to Empiria, or respond to a survey.  If you voluntarily provide your email or other contact information, we might also use it to inform you of changes to Empiria, to survey you about your use or opinion of Empiria, or to ask for your support.  At your request we will remove your contact information from our files.

We do *not* make your contact information or any other personally identifiable information available to anyone outside Empiria or its service providers (who use the information *only* for authorized Empiria purposes) unless we are legally required to do so.

In addition to the above, we collect certain anonymous (non-personally identifiable) information to help us improve the Empiria web site and to evaluate the access and use of Empiria materials and the impact of Empiria on the wordwide gaming community:

* We collect information you provide about your use and satisfaction with Empiria through email you send us, through the Empiria feedback form, and through Empiria surveys, whether or not you voluntarily include your contact information.
* We may use web analysis tools that are built into the Empiria web site to measure and collect anonymous session information.
* We also use "cookies" to improve your Empiria web experience and to collect anonymous information about how you use Empiria. However, cookies are not required for Empiria use.  If your browser is configured not to accept cookies, you will still be able to access Empiria and its content.

When we report information about Empiria access, use, and impact, we repot aggregate, non-personally identifiable data. Occasionally, we report quoted feedback from users. We do not attribute feedback to specific individuals unless we obtain permission to use that person's name along with the feedback.
